## üì¢ Important Note

## üìù Overview

`xtream-proxy` connects to your IPTV provider using XTREAM credentials and retrieves categories and streams for:

- **Live TV**
- **Video-on-Demand (VOD)**
- **Series**

### Key Features:

- Modify channel or group titles.
- Include or exclude specific groups/channels.
- Generate a cleaned and streamlined playlist compatible with players that use XTREAM API calls.

### How It Works:

- Any unsupported API call is seamlessly redirected to your streaming provider, ensuring uninterrupted service.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Obtain valid XTREAM credentials from your IPTV provider.
2. Configure `xtream-proxy` with your credentials and settings.
3. Define filtering and manipulation rules in the configuration file (`xtream.json`).
4. Use the generated playlist in your IPTV player.

Run this Programm on your PC ...

java -cp ./jm3u-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:./* my.xtream.Main

In your IPTV app - replace the URL for your provider with the URL/PORT from your proxy, but keep the credentials from your provider.

e.g. http://my.provider.url becomes http://192.168.2.16:8888

Enjoy a more personalized IPTV experience! üéâ
